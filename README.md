# tofupy

A Python wrapper library around OpenTofu (and Terraform).

This project was built as an example for Chapter 11 of [Terraform in Depth](https://mng.bz/QR21) in order to demonstrate how to wrap the OpenTofu or Terraform binaries to control from another language.

## Installation

Either `tofu` or `terraform` should be installed.

```bash
pip install tofupy
```
